# Invasive species monitoring

As a part of a semester course on globalisation, my chosen topic for the term paper was on the Biological Dimension of Globalisation - with a focus on the impact of invasive species. 

Alien Invasive Species are those species that have been introduced to a foreign environment, either intentionally or unintentionally through various channels.

While exploring deep learning and computer vision, I was looking for a project to which I could apply these concepts. During one such exploration on Kaggle I came accross a dataset of invasive species - hydrangea.

This notebook uses the same dataset from a Kaggle competition based on using computer vision to identify the presence/absence of hydrangea in the input image.

It is trained on around 2500 images and the test set contains around 1500 images.
